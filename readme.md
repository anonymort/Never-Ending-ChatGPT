## About The Project

A simple Firefox extension that auto-scrolls and presses the 'Show more' button in ChatGPT's sidebar to load all previous chats. It is, though, unfortunately hard limited to 100 chats by OpenAI's API.

## Built With

JavaScript, and ChatGPT input of course.

## Getting Started

Either download and built from here using Mozilla's web-ext build function, or from the add-on store (link pending, awaiting approval)

## Roadmap

1. To provide an option to sort alphabetically as well as default listing (by most recent).
2. I'm open to ideas!
